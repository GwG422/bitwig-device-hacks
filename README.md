# Bitwig Modulator Hax

If you're feeling, that Bitwig Modulation system is not complete, you're not
alone. With this tool you will be able to modify the Math device and create
your own.

- `resources/Math.component.c` - source code of the math device
- `resources/Math.mapping.txt` - function name mappings

To build a MathX device, run `python repack.py`.
